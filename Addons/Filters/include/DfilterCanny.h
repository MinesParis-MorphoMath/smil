   * @brief A 2D Canny filter implementation by Vincent Morard
   *
   * Canny edge detection: Canny's aim was to discover the optimal edge
   * detection algorithm. In this situation, an "optimal" edge detector means:
   *
   * - good detection - the algorithm should mark as many real edges in the
   * image as possible.
   *
   * - good localization - edges marked should be as close as possible to the
   * edge in the real image.
   *
   * - minimal response - a given edge in the image should only be marked once,
   * and where possible, image noise should not create false edges.
   *
   * To satisfy these requirements Canny used the calculus of variations - a
   * technique which finds the function which optimizes a given functional.
   *
   * The optimal function in Canny's detector is described by the sum of four
   * exponential terms, but can be approximated by the first derivative of a
   * Gaussian.
