# Smil - Simple (but efficient) Morphological Image Library

Smil is a 2D/3D morphological image library written in C++.

It aims to be lightweight, fast, easy to use and to extend.

Developed using templates, Smil can be used with any standard types (uint8, uint16, uint32). It uses swig and can be wrapped in several languages: for now, python, java, ruby and octave are available.

Smil is free software, available under a BSD-style open source license.

See the licence page for more information.
