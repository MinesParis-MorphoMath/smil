* Documentation

* Check some wrong doxygen tags (everywhere in source code)
  Work in progress...

* maxtree (use histogram to allocate right structures size)

* some functions work only on 2D images (e.g., areaOpen, ...)
  voir avec Bea

* it seems that there are a memory leak problem at watershed function
  Saw in huge images : 2000 x 2000 x 2000 (8 Gb)
  OK - size of iterators variables enough just for image size smaller
  than 32 bits. 

* python online documentation

* Dans CMAKE/CPack
  * ajouter possibles dependances par packet

* Correct tests :
  1 - test_global (Failed)
      Segmentation fault : sometimes
  2 - test_globalMB (Failed)
      Segmentation fault : sometimes
  8 - Base_test_draw (Failed)
      font path problem

* StochasticWS
  Needs   -std=c++11
  OK !

* Doc Addons

* Find a better name for Chabardes Addon

* QVtkViewer : file smilQVtkViewer.i  OK !
  Solve problem when checking getPixel attribute
  Doesn't work because getPixel is defined as an inline method.
  * Temporary check disabled - replace getPixel by another attribute
  * Possible solution : use getPixels

* Advanced DMorphoPathOpening.h
  Lacking doxygen documentation in the end of file
  Ask Petr what to do with this stuff...

* Put Advanced and Addons in a namespace other than smilPython

* Dans les tests :
  * Morpho/include/private/DMorphoDistance.hpp
    * distEuclidean
    * distV0
  Renamed !!!

* In Advanced : GLSZM
  * Shall change int to long to support images bigger than 2 Gpixels 
    (common in 3D images)

* Add Smoothing in Deriche filter

* Verify on FastBilateralFilter 
  * ImFastBilateralFilterRGB - not ported

* Tests on everything

* Tests on python after Swig

* BlobMap template without type name (swig => python)

* Update some CMake package checks :
  FreeType (local) => Freetype (shall disable it ?)
  Python and Python Numpy
  Qwt (local)
  PHP5 (local) => PHP5 ... or even 7 ?

* Conda packages

* Select Python 2 or 3

* review Hough Transform - test fails (inside an infinite loop ?)

* From scikit-image 
  * measures : 
    * entropy
    * image moments :
      centered moments
      with image values or not
    * histogram on blobs
    * entropy on blobs
  * filters
    * 2D -> 3D
    * median
    * min/max
    * multiOtsu
  * convexHull (boundingBox ?)
  * optical flow
  * noise/denoise
  * transforms
    * FFT
    * Radon
    * Hough (better)
  * skimage-viewer ?

* Doc doxygen dev : @devdoc and @enddevdoc
