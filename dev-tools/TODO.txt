* Documentation

* Check some wrong doxygen tags (everywhere in source code)
  Work in progress...
  402-Instructions.doxygen:184: warning: Reached end of file 
  	while still inside a (nested) comment. Nesting level 1 
	(probable line reference: 1)

* maxtree (use histogram to allocate right structures size)
  or C++ map

* some functions work only on 2D images (e.g., areaOpen, ...)
  voir avec Bea

OK -  it seems that there are a memory leak problem at watershed function
  Saw in huge images : 2000 x 2000 x 2000 (8 Gb)
  OK - size of iterators variables enough just for image size smaller
  than 32 bits. 

* python online documentation

* Dans CMAKE/CPack
  * ajouter possibles dependances par packet

OK -  Correct tests :
  1 - test_global (Failed)
      Segmentation fault : sometimes
  2 - test_globalMB (Failed)
      Segmentation fault : sometimes
  8 - Base_test_draw (Failed)
      font path problem

OK -  StochasticWS
  Needs   -std=c++11
    => OK

* Doc Addons

* Find a better name for Chabardes Addon

* QVtkViewer : file smilQVtkViewer.i  OK !
  Solve problem when checking getPixel attribute
  Doesn't work because getPixel is defined as an inline method.
  * Temporary check disabled - replace getPixel by another attribute
  * Possible solution : use getPixels

* Advanced DMorphoPathOpening.h
  Lacking doxygen documentation in the end of file
  Ask Petr what to do with this stuff...

OK -  Put Advanced and Addons in a namespace other than smilPython
  => OK

OK -  Dans les tests :
  OK - Morpho/include/private/DMorphoDistance.hpp
    OK - distEuclidean => OK
    OK - distV0 => OK
  Renamed !!! => OK

OK -  In Advanced : GLSZM
  * Shall change int to long to support images bigger than 2 Gpixels 
    (common in 3D images)

* Add Smoothing in Deriche filter

OK -  Verify on FastBilateralFilter 
  * ImFastBilateralFilterRGB - ported and removed

* Tests on everything

* Tests on python after Swig

* BlobMap template without type name (swig => python)

* Update some CMake package checks :
  FreeType (local) => Freetype (shall disable it ?)
  Python and Python Numpy
  Qwt (local)
  PHP5 (local) => PHP5 ... or even 7 ?

* Conda packages

* Select Python 2 or 3

* review Hough Transform - test fails (inside an infinite loop ?)

* From scikit-image 
  * measures : 
   * entropy => OK
    OK -  image moments :
      centered moments => OK
      with image values or not => OK
    * histogram on blobs
    OK -  entropy on blobs => OK
  * filters
    * 2D -> 3D
    * median
    * min/max
    * multiOtsu
  * convexHull (boundingBox ?)
  * optical flow
  * noise/denoise
  * transforms
    * FFT
    * Radon
    * Hough (better)
  * skimage-viewer ?

* Other functions to add :
  * other kinds of gradients (See Soille 2003)

* Doc doxygen dev : @devdoc and @enddevdoc

* Rotation of Structured elements (works only on 2D) - DCompositeSE.cpp

* Check why test_transform fails on nestor and taurus.
  Probably conversion double -> T

* Accelerate Soille line morphology functions

* Accelerate histogramMap
