 * @page p610 Quick start with smilPython
 *
 * @section s610_01 Generalities
 *
 * Most @Smil features are available under @Python, thanks to @Swig as a
 * module names @smilPython.
 *
 *
 * @section s610_02 Your first program
 *
 * Type the following lines in your prefered text editor (copy and paste works
 * fine) and name it, e.g., @TT{first-smil.py}.
 *
 * @includelineno first-program.py
 * Run it and try to modify it.
 * @note
 *  - near all @Smil functions return a value which means :
 *    - @TB{1} - if the function executed with no error
 *    - @TB{0} or @TB{any other value} - an error occured. Usually there will
 *      be some message to explain the error.
 *  - it's a good practice to verify the returned value and stop processing on
 *    errors and handle it.
 *
 * @section s610_03 Some rules
 * *
 * TBD
