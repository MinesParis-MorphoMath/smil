 * @section s280_104 Smil 1.1.1 (17 September 2024)
 *  - @TB{New}
 *    - Function Version() on Python interface - returning Smil Version
 *  - @TB{Change}
 *    - Remove dependencies on X86 and Linux, to be able to run on other
 *      architectures and operating systems.
 *  - @TB{Bug}
 *    - Bug on function fromNumpyArray() which works only on 3D images.
 * @section s280_104 Smil 1.1 (14 May 2024)
 *  - @TB{New}
 *    - Structuring elements @TB{CenteredLineSE()} and @TB{CenteredLine3DSE()}
 *      created in complement to @TB{LineSE()} and @TB{Line3DSE()}
 *    - functions rectangleDilate(), rectangleErode(),
 *      rectangleOpen() and rectangleClose(). Generic functions
 *      based on line morphology.
 *  - @TB{Change}
 *    - In functions LineSE() and Line3DSE(), angle units changed from
 *      @TB{degres} do @TB{radians}.
 *    - function @TB{stretchHist()} renamed to stretchHistogram().)
 *    - function @TB{fastLambdaLabel()} removed as its results are wrong. Use
 *      function @TB{lambdaLabel()} which gives correct results.
 *    - Option @TB{--imagetypes} to define data types for gray images. Default
 *      values is @TB{UINT8;UINT16;UINT32}
 *    - A plugin @TB{Samg} was added with functions from old \TT{Chabardes} plugin.
 *      These functions are needed by @TB{Samg} functions. The aren't
 *      documented.
 *    - Experimental code to do @SIMD parallel processing was removed as it
 *      is specific to @Intel processors. Better use @OpenMP feature for
 *      this.
 *  - @TB{Bug}
 *    - Deprecated function in @Numpy API, since release 1.19. New code needs
 *      release 1.15 or newer.
 *    - Problems when getting the cardinality of values in @TB{UINT32} images
 *      in the @TB{cardinality()} function.
 *    - Attribute opening/closing based on MaxTree - Problem with memory
 *      allocation on MaxTree limiting the size of image being handled.
 *    - circleErode() and circleDilate() - functions based on line StrElt
 *      doesn't match expected radius. Improved but still not perfect.
 *    - some warnings about @Qt deprecated functions.
 *  - @TB{Documentation}
 *    - minor error corrections and adaptation to the above changes.
 *

 *  - @TB{Change}
 *    - @TT{distanceEuclidean()} - replaced by another one based on hierarchical
